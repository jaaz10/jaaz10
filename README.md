I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first PHP project, "KlickClothing". The consolidated toolchain makes me want to leacve the JavaScript ecosystem behind for good. I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing PHP or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
